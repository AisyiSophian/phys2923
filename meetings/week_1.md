**Date:** 05/08/2025  
**Time:** 11:00AM - 12:15PM   
**Location:** Physics 356

## Summary
- Introduction to Asteroseismology
- What is TESS?
- Gave websites and useful papers
- Task: find candidate stars (from the given data set)

## Discussion Notes

TESS observation NASA mission:  
Look for changes in brigtness in a portion of night sky (scintillation)

Read paper about TESS 

Look at S91, S92 sectors of the TESS data set (target the brightest stars) 

To do: 

Read the whole TESS website
(understand how it works)

Sign up for Slack

2pm friday group meeting, next week in room 414A

What to do: investigate sector 91/92

Dan Hey dataset

TICID: number of the star
tess input catalogue ID

CCD charge couple device

tmag: tess magnitude (the lesser the number, the brighter the star)
(on a log scale)


NOT IN THE ECLIPTIC PLANE, IN THE EQUATORIAL PLANE
RA: Right ascension (measured in degrees), more often in hours (minutes and seconds)
equivalent to the longitude of the sky

DEC declination 
latitude (always in degrees)
-90 degree to +90 degree

sector
91 or 92

count = 1, newly-observed

FOR SIMBAD:
to search, put “TIC <ID>”

focus on spectral types: M1

for references, use ‘SCORE” output settings


LIGHTCURVE INSPECTOR PLOT:
Normalized flux vs day (which spans 25 days = 2 TESS orbit cycle)


OTHER SPACE MISSIONS:
BRITE mission
MOST mission

to convert intrinsic brightness to apparent, use log and distance

make a spreadsheet of starts categorised by spectral types
