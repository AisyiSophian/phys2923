# Week 1 Logbook
**Student:** Aisyi Sophian  
**Supervisor:** Prof. Tim Bedding  
**Project Title:** Asteroseismology with TESS Data  
**Unit of Study:** Astrophysics and Relativity (SSP)  
**Date:** 4–10 August 2025  

---

## 📖 Summary
- Introduction to TESS and Asteroseismology
- Set up coding environment

## ✅ Goals for This Week
- Read about Nasa's TESS mission
- Familiarise with Slack
- Learn Markdown
- Write meeting minute and logbook in Markdown
- Review all of the materials given by Tim
- Analyse the catalogue of stars for sector 91 & 92 using Python (or Excel)
- Sort the stars by spectral types
- Filter out several potential candidate stars (which are not too bright and not affected by the Earth's shine)
- Create a rough timeline of how the project is going to run throughout the semester
- Come up with a research question

---

## 📅 Meetings & Communication
- **Meeting with Tim:** 5 Aug 2025 · 11:00 · Tuesday  
  *Summary:* Tim explained the basis of Asteroseismology. Provided research papers, data set of stars (from sector 91 & 92), websites, and several Python packages (Lightkurve, Pandas).
- **Slack updates:** Joined Slack group, briefly introduced myself and synced with my partner.

---

## 🧠 Work Done / Progress
- Installed Slack using Homebrew via the Zsh terminal
- Installed "Markdown All In One" extension on VS Code
- Installed Jupyter Lab package via Miniconda
- Read about TESS.
- Watched YouTube videos about TESS.
- Installed necessary packages: numpy, astropy, matplotlib, jupyterlab, lightkurve

---

## 📌 Key Learnings
- Brief understanding about TESS and its purposes.
- Learned elliptical coordinate systems

---

## 🧩 Problems Encountered
- VS Code did not correctly render LaTeX, so I used Jupyter Lab
- Scrolling through Jupyter Lab notebooks is laggy
- Lightkurve package couldn't be installed on Python 3.13, fixed when used Python 3.11
